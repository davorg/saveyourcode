# About Save Your Code

## About Source Code Control

Source code control (also called version control) is a way to save, track,
and manage the changes you make to your code over time. It’s like having an
unlimited undo button, a time machine for your projects, and a way to
collaborate — all rolled into one.

Whether you’re working solo or in a team, it helps you:

- Keep a history of your work
- Try out experiments without breaking your main project
- Go back when something breaks (or when AI gives you code that almost works)
- Collaborate smoothly with others

For modern developers, it’s an essential tool — not just for pros, but for
hobbyists, learners, and vibe coders too.

## About Git and GitHub

Git is the most popular source control tool in the world. It runs on your
local machine and lets you manage your code’s history with precision.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, making it easy
to back up your work, share it with others, and collaborate across the
internet.

Together, Git and GitHub give you:

- Local save points for your code
- Cloud backups you can access anywhere
- Tools to track changes, suggest improvements, and roll back mistakes

But let’s be honest: **Git can feel intimidating at first** — especially if
you’re self-taught, learning from AI tools, or just hacking on side projects.
That’s why Save Your Code exists: to demystify these tools and help you use
them effectively, without needing a CS degree or memorising obscure commands.

## About Your Guide

Hi, I’m Dave Cross.

I’m a software developer, writer, and teacher with decades of experience —
and I’ve been helping people learn programming, data wrangling, and software
craftsmanship since the 1990s.

These days, I’m fascinated by the intersection of AI-assisted coding and
practical developer skills. I started Save Your Code because I saw how many
people were jumping into coding through tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and
Claude — but without the version control skills to back up their progress.

This site is here to help you **save your experiments, recover from mistakes,
and share your successes** — all with minimal fuss and maximal kindness.

Thanks for joining me!
