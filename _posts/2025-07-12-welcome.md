# Welcome to Save Your Code

![Welcome to software development](/assets/images/welcome.png)

Hi there! 👋 I’m thrilled you’ve found your way here.

This site is for anyone who’s coding in the 2020s — which often means:

- Writing snippets with help from ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot
- Experimenting with ideas in Jupyter, VS Code, or random online playgrounds
- Building projects on weekends, in side hustles, or just for fun

If that’s you, you’ve probably hit **this moment**:

> _“Wait… where did my last working version go?”_

Or:

> _“Oops… I copied over something that was working, and now it’s broken.”_

Or:

> _“Hey, this actually works… I should share it!”_

That’s where **source code control** — and this site — comes in.

## What You’ll Learn Here

Save Your Code is here to help you:

✅ Understand the basics of source control  
✅ Use Git confidently (no, you don’t need to learn every command)  
✅ Back up your work to the cloud (GitHub, GitLab, or wherever)  
✅ Collaborate or share your projects when you’re ready

No gatekeeping. No elitist assumptions. Just practical advice.

## Why It Matters

AI-assisted coding has opened the door for **more people than ever** to experiment, learn, and build.  
But too many of us (yes, me too) have learned the hard way that code you don’t save… vanishes.

This site will help you change that — with simple, repeatable habits and tools.

Thanks for being here. Let’s save your code — and your sanity — together.
